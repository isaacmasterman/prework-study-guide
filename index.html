        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to structure content on the web.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>In HTML, elements can be nested inside other elements. The outer element is called the "parent", and the inner element is called the "child".
          <li>HTML elements typically consist of a starting (or opening) tag and an ending (or closing) tag. The ending tag is similar to the starting tag but has a forward slash before the element name.

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to style and layout web pages. It determines how elements are displayed on the screen.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Selectors are used in CSS to target and apply styles to specific HTML elements. For example, h1 { color: blue; } will make all h1 elements blue.</li>
          <li>Hex code formatting is a way to specify colors in CSS. It uses a combination of six characters (numbers and/or letters) preceded by a hash (#). For example, #FF5733 represents a shade of orange.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git commit -m "Your message here": Commits the staged changes along with a descriptive message explaining what was done.</li>
          <li>git pull origin branch-name: Fetches the changes from the remote repository's specified branch and merges them into the current local branch.</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: Uploads your committed changes on the specified local branch to the remote repository, making them accessible to others and synced with the remote branch.</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A 'for' statement is a loop that repeatedly executes a block of code for a specified number of times, typically based on the initialization, condition, and increment/decrement of a loop variable.</li>
          <li>An 'if' statement is a conditional statement that allows code to be executed only if a certain condition is true. It can be combined with 'else' and 'else if' clauses to handle multiple conditions.</li>
          <li>A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It can take in parameters and return a value, allowing for modular and organized programming.</li>
