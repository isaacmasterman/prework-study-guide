        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to structure content on the web.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>In HTML, elements can be nested inside other elements. The outer element is called the "parent", and the inner element is called the "child".
          <li>HTML elements typically consist of a starting (or opening) tag and an ending (or closing) tag. The ending tag is similar to the starting tag but has a forward slash before the element name.
